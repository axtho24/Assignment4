        <p class="title">Childish Gambino Isn't Done Rapping</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0em; margin-bottom:2em;"><img src="file:///Users/Mainbrain/Documents/TIY/Assignment4/avatar.png" width="20em" height="20em"> <span class="name">Anne Marie</span> <span class="date"> on <span class="datedecor">Monday Oct. 27th 9:22pm</span></span></p>
        <p>Donald Glover has long proven himself to be a man of many passions. You've heard it plenty of times before, but a quick refresher: The 31-year-old is an accomplished rapper, actor, comedian and writer -- among other talents. So, really, it's not all that surprising when one of those pursuits takes precedence over another at a given moment.<br/></p>
        <p>In that spirit, it sounds like Childish Gambino, Glover's longtime rap moniker, may be coming to an end. “I always wanna do music. I love music. And I wanna be putting out projects quietly everywhere, and I wanna produce. I guess Childish Gambino is a period in my art time," he said on "Today" on Tuesday. "I want to have periods in my life. I feel like Childish Gambino is a period that should come to a close. I like endings.”</p>
        <p>Whether this means he's falling back from what we've come to know Childish Gambino for -- the rapping -- or merely moving on from the name, remains to be seen. As a fan of his music, I'm hoping it's the latter.</p>
        <div class="verticalLine">New Video on Youtube</div>
        <p>In any case, he further explained his outlook towards his art. “I look at my life as something you should be able to paint," he said. "I think it is kinda like performance art.” No matter what goes on with the music -- his most recent release, by the way, was October's STN MTN / Kauai -- we know that Donald's on his acting grind right now.
          For one, he's starring in "The Lazarus Effect," in theaters on Friday, Feb. 27. Plus, there are rumors that he may be tapped to play Spider-Man.
        <p>"I can't say I'm the next Spider-Man; I can't say [I'm not], either," he said. “There’s been talkings about it. I’d be honored to play it, but it’s really not up to me. I just want Spider-Man to be good.”</p>
        <p>Donald Glover has had an eclectic career in the entertainment industry. Perhaps best known for playing Troy Barnes on the cult comedy show "Community," he has also written for "30 Rock," guest-starred on both HBO's "Girls" and Cartoon Network's "Adventure Time," and has performed stand-up comedy. One of his most well-known activities has been performing rap and hip hop under the stage name Childish Gambino. Below are ten of his best works.</p>

        <p class="sidetext">Before Donald Glover begins his stand-up special Weirdo, he warns his audience;
          telling them that his routine is going to be nothing like his role as Troy on NBC’s series Community.
          Giving the impression that dreaming about Lady Gaga playing a bass shaped like a tampon and comparing mean
          little children to Hitler wouldn’t be added to the primetime TV show’s script any time soon. One thing you
          can count on is Glover delivering a solid performance that pokes fun at childhood experiences and
          schizophrenic homeless people.</p>
